# Leaf-disease-identification

Project description: I'm training a model to identify healthy plant leaves and infected plant leaves by providing a set of data for training and testing.

While conducting a survey looking for the problems in agriculture which can be solved through technology, I came across a number of problems and decided to take off on each problem.

In the past, I've identified the problem of adverse weather in agriculture and came up with a chatbot which is capable of updating the farmer with live forecast and which can alert farmers a week before any upcoming storm. I even included language translation in the chatbot which provides the farmers with all the information they need in the tip of their fingers.

One such problem I'm addressing now is the ruthless destruction of crops due to agricultural pests. There are many different kinds of destructive pests, from termites that eat your home’s structure to bed bugs that bite you while you sleep. Some of the worst, however, are pests that feed on plants. Agricultural pests can not only ruin gardens, but they can also ruin entire crops meant to feed hundreds of people.A study by Cambridge shows that every year, farmers combat a variety of pests to make sure their fruits, vegetables, and grains grow successfully. Among crops, the total global potential loss due to pests varied from about 50% in wheat to more than 80% in cotton production. The responses are estimated as losses of 26–29% for soybean, wheat and cotton, and 31, 37 and 40% for maize, rice and potatoes, respectively. Overall, weeds produced the highest potential loss (34%), with animal pests and pathogens being less important (losses of 18 and 16%).

Hence there's a need for identifying diseased leaves and treat them accordingly.

In this project, I'm going to train a Machine Learning model which will take leaf images as input and will give out information such as whether the crop is infected, what type of pest/ disease is the reason, what is the cure etc.

This will help the farmers to know their crop better and can take necessary actions.

Dataset: I'm using dataset from Kaggle.
