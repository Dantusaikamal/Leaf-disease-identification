# Leaf-disease-identification

Project description: I'm training a model to identify healthy plant leaves and infected plant leaves by providing a set of data for training and testing.

How will we proceed:

data: I'm using dataset from Kaggle. 

Testing and training: We can divide the data weâ€™ve collected into two sets for testing and training. We can again use Python to test and train our model.
